## **Dataset Description**
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset)  
- **Rows**: 973  
- **Columns**: 15  
  - Example columns: `Weight`, `Calories Burned`, `Experience Level`, `Workout Types`, `Fat Percentage`.  

---

## **Project Objectives**
- Predict gym membersâ€™ BMI categories using machine learning models.  
- Analyze trends in workout habits and their correlation with body composition.  
- Develop clear, Plotly-dominant visualizations to enhance understanding.

## **Project Workflow**

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and formatting features.
- Standardized data for compatibility with machine learning models.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized trends focusing on BMI distribution and correlations.
- Used interactive Plotly visualizations to present findings.

### **Machine Learning**
- Trained and tested several machine learning models to predict BMI categories.
- Evaluated model performance based on precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.

### **Summary**
- Derived actionable insights from data exploration and machine learning results.

## **Key Findings**
1. The dataset requires additional, stronger features for reliable prediction models.
2. **SVC (Support Vector Classifier):** Outperformed other models due to its balance between precision, recall, and accuracy.
3. **HIIT Popularity:** While effective for weight loss, HIIT has lower adoption rates, likely due to its high-intensity nature.
4. **Gender Trends:** Males are moderately more likely to be obese than females.


## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `numpy` for statistical calculations  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
  - sklearn for machine learning
- **Platforms**: Kaggle Notebook for analysis and presentation.

---

## **Future Work**
- Enhance the dataset with more diverse and impactful features.
- Explore advanced machine learning models such as neural networks for BMI prediction.
- Analyze the long-term impacts of specific workout types on body composition.
